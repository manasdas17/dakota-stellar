Blurb:: Relative cost profile for solution levels

Description:: This specification provides a profile of relative costs
corresponding to an ordered hierarchy of solution control values
(e.g., discretization levels). 

<!-- <b> Default Behavior </b> -->

<!-- <b> Expected Output </b> -->

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The order of the cost values should correspond to the order of the
discrete set or range values that can be assumed by the variable
identified by \c solution_level_control.

<!-- <b> Additional Discussion </b> -->

Topics::
Examples::
The discrete variable identified by the descriptor 'N_x' should have
four values in its set or range, corresponding to the length of the
cost specification.  The solution_level_cost is neither strictly
ascending or descending, rather it should match the order of the
discrete values assumed by 'N_x'.
\verbatim
model,
	id_model = 'SIM1'
	simulation
	  solution_level_control = 'N_x'
	  solution_level_cost = 630. 1260. 2100. 4200.
