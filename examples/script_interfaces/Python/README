=== Interface to a simulation written in Python ===

--Files--

dakota_rosenbrock_python.in:	Dakota input file
rosenbrock_bb_dipy.py:		Analysis driver (interface) that uses the 
				Dakota-supplied dipy module to read the 
				parameters file write the results file.
rosenbrock_bb.py:		Analysis driver (interface) that directly
				parses the parameters file and writes the
				results file.
rosenbrock.py:			The simulation, which is imported by the
				analysis drivers.


--Instructions--

As-is, dakota_rosenbrock_python.in is configured to run on Linux or OSX and to 
use rosenbrock_bb_dipy.py as the analysis driver. If you are a Windows user,
modify the .in file according to the comments it contains. In order for this
analysis driver to function correcty, Python >= 2.6 must be installed, and the
path share/dakota/interfaces/Python in the Dakota installation folder must 
be added to your PYTHONPATH so that the dipy module can be located.


The other analysis driver can be demonstrated by modifying the analysis_driver
keyword.
